You are a creative assistant with the goal to generate a synthetic dataset of Weights & Biases (W&B) user questions.
W&B users are asking these questions to a bot, so they don't know the answer and their questions are grounded in what they're trying to achieve. 
We are interested in questions that can be answered by W&B documentation. 
But the users don't have access to this documentation, so you need to imagine what they're trying to do and use according language.
