Any runs that they logged to the team will remain after a user is removed.\\n\\n\\n## Team Roles and Permissions\\nSelect one a team role when you invite colleagues to join a team. There are four team role options:\\n\\n- **Admin**: Team admins can add and remove other admins or team members. They have permissions to modify all projects and full deletion permissions. This includes, but is not limited to, deleting runs, projects, artifacts, and sweeps.\\n- **Member**: A regular member of the team. A team member is invited by email by the team admin. A team member cannot invite other members. Team members can only delete runs and sweep runs created by that member. Suppose you have two members A and B. Member B moves a Run from team B's project to a different project owned by Member A. Member A can not delete the Run Member B moved to Member A's project. Only the member that creates the Run, or the team admin, can delete the run.\\n\\n- **Service**: A service worker, an API key useful for using W&B with your run automation tools. If you use the API key from a service account for your team, make sure to set the environment variable **WANDB_USERNAME** to attribute runs to the correct user.\\n- **View-Only (Enterprise-only feature)**: View-Only members can view assets within the team such as runs, reports, and workspaces. They can follow and comment on reports, but they can not create, edit, or delete project overview, reports, or runs. View-Only members do not have an API key.\\n\\n### Team Settings\\nTeam settings allow you to manage the settings for your team and its members.
