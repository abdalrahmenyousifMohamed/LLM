They have read the documentation on tagging runs but still have some doubts.\n\nQUESTION: How can I add tags to my runs in Weights & Biases?\n\nANSWER:\nTo add tags to a run in Weights & Biases, you can use the `wandb.init()` function when initializing the run. Simply pass a list of tags as an argument, like this: `wandb.init(tags=[\"tag1\", \"tag2\"])`. \n\nIf you want to update the tags of a run during training based on certain conditions, you can do so by accessing the `run.tags` attribute. For example, if a particular metric crosses a pre-defined threshold, you can add a new tag to the run using the following code:\n\n```python\nrun = wandb.init(tags=[\"debug\"])\n\n# ... training code ...\n\nif current_loss < threshold:\n    run.tags.append(\"release_candidate\")\n```\n\nAdditionally, there are other ways to add tags after runs have been logged to Weights & Biases. You can update tags using the Public API by fetching the run object and modifying its `tags` attribute. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nrun = wandb.Api().run(\"{entity}/{project}/{run-id}\"})\nrun.tags.append(\"tag1\")  # you can choose tags based on run data here\nrun.update()\n```\n\nYou can find more information about using the Public API in the [reference documentation](../../../ref/README.md) and the [Public API guide](../../../guides/track/public-api-guide.md).\n\nOn the Project Page, you can bulk tag runs by selecting them in the runs table and clicking on the Tag button. This method is useful when you want to tag a large number of runs with the same tag or tags.\n\nI hope this information helps!

They want to be able to easily identify and categorize their runs based on different criteria.\n\nQUESTION: How can I add tags to my runs in Weights & Biases?\n\nANSWER: To add tags to your runs in Weights & Biases, you have several options. \n- When creating a run, you can specify the tags directly: `wandb.init(tags=[\"tag1\", \"tag2\"])`.\n- During training, you can update the tags dynamically based on certain conditions. For example, if a particular metric crosses a predefined threshold, you can update the tags of the run:  \n```python\nif current_loss < threshold:\n    run.tags = run.tags + (\"release_candidate\",)\n```\n- After a run is created, you can update the tags using the Weights & Biases public API. Here is an example of how you can update tags using the API:\n```python\nrun = wandb.Api().run(\"{entity}/{project}/{run-id}\"})\nrun.tags.append(\"tag1\")\nrun.update()\n```\nYou can find more information about adding tags to runs in the [Weights & Biases documentation on the Public API](../../../guides/track/public-api-guide.md).\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:09:49", "2023-07-16T01:10:05.037622", "chatcmpl-7chkTGZn8b4sM3te5ejBGvJJSMuNE", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 16.037622333999934, 904, 1701, 2605]]}
