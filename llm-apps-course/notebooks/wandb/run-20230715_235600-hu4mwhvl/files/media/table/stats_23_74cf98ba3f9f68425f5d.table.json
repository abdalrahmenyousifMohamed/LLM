Now, I want to change the plot type from scatter to line. How can I do that?\n\nANSWER: To change the plot type from scatter to line, you can click on **Edit** and update the Vega spec for the chart. In the Vega spec, change the value of the \"mark\" field from \"point\" to \"line\". This will switch the plot type from scatter to line. Additionally, if there are any unused fields in the Vega spec, you can remove them to clean up the visualization.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:16:56", "2023-07-16T01:17:04.567176", "chatcmpl-7chrMP3R0uXOSapDZzodUHF96PhiP", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 8.567175791999944, 1008, 866, 1874]]}
