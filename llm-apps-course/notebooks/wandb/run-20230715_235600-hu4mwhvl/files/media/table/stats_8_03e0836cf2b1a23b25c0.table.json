This allows you to easily organize and reproduce your experiments. You can log each Artifact using the `run.log_artifact(artifact)` method, which will create a new version of the Artifact and track it in W&B.

Each artifact represents a specific dataset and can be logged with a unique name and metadata. This allows you to easily track and manage multiple datasets throughout your project. You can use the `add_dir` method to add the dataset directory to the artifact, and then log the artifact using the `run.log_artifact` method.

The dataset directory 'nature-data' is added to the artifact using the `add_dir` method. Finally, the artifact is logged using the `run.log_artifact` method.
