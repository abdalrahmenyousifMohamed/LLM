They have defined an objective/training function and want to specify the search space for the hyperparameters. They also want to know how W&B determines which metric to maximize or minimize during the sweep.\n\nQUESTION: \nHow can I define the search space for my hyperparameter sweep in W&B? Also, how does W&B determine which metric to maximize or minimize during the sweep?\n\nANSWER: \nTo define the search space for your hyperparameter sweep in W&B, you can use a sweep configuration dictionary. In this dictionary, you can specify the hyperparameters you want to sweep over and their corresponding values or ranges. In the example provided in the documentation, the sweep configuration specifies a random search method and defines two hyperparameters, 'x' and 'y'.\n```python\nsweep_configuration = {\n    'method': 'random',\n    'metric': {'goal': 'minimize', 'name': 'score'},\n    'parameters': \n    {\n        'x': {'max': 0.1, 'min': 0.01},\n        'y': {'values': [1, 3, 7]},\n     }\n}\n```\nThis configuration will randomly select values for 'x' within the range of 0.01 to 0.1 and values for 'y' from the list [1, 3, 7]. \n\nAs for the metric to maximize or minimize during the sweep, you can specify it under the 'metric' key in the sweep configuration. In the example, the metric is set to minimize the 'score' metric.\n```python\n'metric': {'goal': 'minimize', 'name': 'score'}\n```\nThis means that W&B will try to find hyperparameter combinations that minimize the 'score' metric during the sweep. You can adjust this based on your specific objective.\n\nMake sure to initialize the sweep with the sweep configuration using `wandb.sweep` to get a sweep identification number.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:08:51", "2023-07-16T01:09:05.398631", "chatcmpl-7chjXp5bdEOMBivDXPImK60nrqHhy", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 14.398630749999938, 911, 1224, 2135], ["\n\n**system**: You are a creative assistant with the goal to generate a synthetic dataset of Weights & Biases (W&B) user questions.\nW&B users are asking these questions to a bot, so they don't know the answer and their questions are grounded in what they're trying to achieve. \nWe are interested in questions that can be answered by W&B documentation. \nBut the users don't have access to this documentation, so you need to imagine what they're trying to do and use according language.\n\n\n**user**: Here are some examples of real user questions, you will be judged by how well you match this distribution.\n***\nhow do i use artifacts references?\nwhy am I getting an error  \n__init__() got an unexpected keyword argument 'no_args_is_help'\nwhen I try to run wandb on a server for a cloud GPU?
