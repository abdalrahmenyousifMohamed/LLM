For example, you can use a dictionary to specify the method of search, the metric to maximize, and the parameters to sweep over.

First, make sure that both the W&B Sweep and the W&B Run are in the same project. This means that the name you provide when you initialize W&B must match the name of the project you provide when you initialize a W&B Sweep. Next, define your search space by specifying the hyperparameters you want to sweep over. In your sweep configuration, you can specify different methods for the search, such as random search. You also need to define the metric you want to maximize or minimize during the sweep. Once your sweep configuration is defined, you can initialize the sweep by calling `wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project='my-first-sweep')`. This will return a sweep identification number. Finally, you can start the sweep using the `wandb.agent` API call, passing the sweep identification number and the main function to be executed for each run.
