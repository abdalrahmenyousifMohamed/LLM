If `define`_`metric` _ isn't used, then the last value logged with appear in your summary metrics. See the `define_metric` [reference docs here](https://docs.wandb.ai/ref/python/run#define\\_metric) and the [guide here](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/track/log#customize-axes-and-summaries-with-define\\_metric) for more.\n\nTo tell W&B to keep track of the max validation accuracy in the W&B summary metric, you just need to call `wandb.define_metric` once, e.g. you can call it at the beginning of training like so:\n\n```python\nclass My_LitModule(LightningModule):\n    ...\n    \n    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n        if trainer.global_step == 0: \n            wandb.define_metric('val_accuracy', summary='max')\n        \n        preds, loss, acc = self._get_preds_loss_accuracy(batch)\n\n        # Log loss and metric\n        self.log('val_loss', loss)\n        self.log('val_accuracy', acc)\n        return preds\n```\n\n### Model Checkpointing\n\nCustom checkpointing to W&B can be set up through the PyTorch Lightning [`ModelCheckpoint`](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/stable/api/pytorch\\_lightning.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint.html#pytorch\\_lightning.callbacks.ModelCheckpoint) when the log\\_model argument is used in the `WandbLogger`:\n\n```python\n# log model only if `val_accuracy` increases\nwandb_logger = WandbLogger(log_model=\"all\")\ncheckpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(monitor=\"val_accuracy\", mode=\"max\")\ntrainer = Trainer(logger=wandb_logger, callbacks=[checkpoint_callback])\n\n***\nYou will now generate a user question and corresponding answer based on the above document. \nFirst, explain the user context and what problems they might be trying to solve. \nSecond, generate user question. \nThird, provide the accurate and concise answer in markdown format to the user question using the documentation. \nYou'll be evaluated on:\n- how realistic is that this question will come from a real user one day? \n- is this question about W&B? \n- can the question be answered using the W&B document fragment above? \n- how accurate is the answer?\nRemember that users have different styles and can be imprecise. You are very good at impersonating them!\nUse the following format:\nCONTEXT: \nQUESTION: \nANSWER: \nLet's start!\n", "\n\n**assistant**: CONTEXT: The user is training a PyTorch Lightning model using Weights & Biases (W&B) and wants to track the minimum and maximum validation accuracy in the W&B summary metrics.\n\nQUESTION: How can I specify whether I want to track the minimum or maximum value for a metric in the W&B summary metrics?\n\nANSWER: To specify whether you want to track the minimum or maximum value for a metric in the W&B summary metrics, you can use the `wandb.define_metric` function. You can call this function at the beginning of your training, for example in the `validation_step` method of your PyTorch Lightning `LightningModule`. Here is an example:\n\n```python\nclass My_LitModule(LightningModule):\n    ...\n    \n    def validation_step(self, batch, batch_idx):\n        if trainer.global_step == 0: \n            wandb.define_metric('val_accuracy', summary='max')\n        \n        preds, loss, acc = self._get_preds_loss_accuracy(batch)\n\n        # Log loss and metric\n        self.log('val_loss', loss)\n        self.log('val_accuracy', acc)\n        return preds\n```\n\nIn this example, the `wandb.define_metric` function is used to specify that the maximum value of `val_accuracy` should be tracked in the W&B summary metrics.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:08:24", "2023-07-16T01:08:33.566983", "chatcmpl-7chj6HqSqghLJWMEGtvQtrlz4D1de", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 9.566983207999783, 914, 1274, 2188]]}
