They are also interested in tracking the validation accuracy and determining the maximum value achieved.\n\nQUESTION: \nHi wandbot, I'm training a model using PyTorch Lightning and W&B, and I want to save the best model checkpoints based on validation accuracy. How can I achieve this?\n\nANSWER: \nTo save the best model checkpoints based on validation accuracy, you can use the `ModelCheckpoint` callback from PyTorch Lightning in combination with the `log_model` argument in `WandbLogger`. Here's an example of how you can set it up:\n\n```python\nimport pytorch_lightning as pl\nfrom pytorch_lightning.callbacks import ModelCheckpoint\n\n# Create a ModelCheckpoint callback\ncheckpoint_callback = ModelCheckpoint(monitor=\"val_accuracy\", mode=\"max\")\n\n# Create a WandbLogger with `log_model` as \"all\"\nwandb_logger = pl.loggers.WandbLogger(log_model=\"all\")\n\n# Create a trainer with the callback and logger\ntrainer = pl.Trainer(callbacks=[checkpoint_callback], logger=wandb_logger)\n\n# Train your model using the trainer\ntrainer.fit(model)\n```\n\nThis setup will save the best model checkpoints based on the maximum value of the validation accuracy metric. You can retrieve the latest or best model checkpoint from W&B Artifacts using the aliases \"latest\" or \"best\".\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:02:33", "2023-07-16T01:02:46.865098", "chatcmpl-7chdRt85UrG7Hor2Hgr6gdjlK3iPi", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 13.86509787499972, 906, 1389, 2295]]}
