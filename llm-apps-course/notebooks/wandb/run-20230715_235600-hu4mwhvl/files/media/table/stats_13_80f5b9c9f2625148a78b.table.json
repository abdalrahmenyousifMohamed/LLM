However, they are facing a problem with the way the scores are logged as a chart with step-score x-y axes. They want to know if there is a way to log the scores as a scalar value instead for easier visualization.\n\nQUESTION: How can I log the scores of my LightGBM regression model in Weights & Biases as a scalar value instead of a chart with step-score x-y axes?\n\nANSWER: To log the scores of your LightGBM regression model as a scalar value instead of a chart in Weights & Biases, you can use the `wandb.log` function with the `commit` argument set to `False`. Here is an example: `wandb.log({'dev_score': dev_score}, commit=False)`. This will log the score as a scalar value and it will not be displayed as a chart with multiple steps.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:10:33", "2023-07-16T01:10:48.290210", "chatcmpl-7chlBCqeUKyIYGPTzwBqLyX83fTJD", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 15.290209917000084, 1194, 1586, 2780], ["\n\n**system**: You are a creative assistant with the goal to generate a synthetic dataset of Weights & Biases (W&B) user questions.\nW&B users are asking these questions to a bot, so they don't know the answer and their questions are grounded in what they're trying to achieve. \nWe are interested in questions that can be answered by W&B documentation. \nBut the users don't have access to this documentation, so you need to imagine what they're trying to do and use according language.\n\n\n**user**: Here are some examples of real user questions, you will be judged by how well you match this distribution.\n***\nI have the following code, which finds a sweep by the sweep's display name and then gets the runs associated with it.\n```\ndef get_sweeps_by_sweep_name(entity, project, sweep_name, require_unique = True):\n    sweep_ids = []\n    for sweep in api.from_path(f\"{entity}/{project}\").sweeps():\n        if sweep.name == sweep_name:\n            sweep_ids.append(sweep.id)\n    if require_unique == True and len(sweep_ids) > 1:\n        raise ValueError(\"There are multiple sweeps with the same name\")\n    return sweep_ids # singular if require_unique == True\n\ndef get_runs_by_sweep_name(entity, project, sweep_name):\n    sweep_ids = get_sweeps_by_sweep_name(entity, project, sweep_name, require_unique = True)\n    return api.runs(f\"{entity}/{project}\", filters={\"sweep\": sweep_ids[0]})\n\n# call with\nsweepruns = get_runs_by_sweep_name(\"MYENTITY\", \"MYPROJECT\", \"MYRUNNAME1\")\n```\n\nIs there a better way to do this, maybe with just a single filter?\nHi I have created an academic team, however I don't have admin rights in my own group and cannot access admin features at all\nI am logging the score of my LightGBM regression model by doing `run = wandb.init(project=project_name)` and then `wandb.log({'dev_score': dev_score})`.

How can I add a Scalar chart instead?\n***\nIn the next step, you will read a fragment of W&B documentation.\nThis will serve as inspiration for synthetic user question and the source of the answer. \nHere is the document fragment:\n***\n over union (IOU), or we might want to know how well different models detect cars (large, common regions in the data) versus traffic signs (much smaller, less common regions). In the[ demo Colab](https://bit.ly/custom-charts-colab), you can compare the confidence scores for two of the ten classes of living things.\n\n![](/images/app_ui/composite_histograms.png)\n\nTo create your own version of the custom composite histogram panel:\n\n1. Create a new Custom Chart panel in your Workspace or Report (by adding a \u201cCustom Chart\u201d visualization). Hit the \u201cEdit\u201d button in the top right to modify the Vega spec starting from any built-in panel type.\n2. Replace that built-in Vega spec with my [MVP code for a composite histogram in Vega](https://gist.github.com/staceysv/9bed36a2c0c2a427365991403611ce21). You can modify the main title, axis titles, input domain, and any other details directly in this Vega spec [using Vega syntax](https://vega.github.io/) (you could change the colors or even add a third histogram :)\n3. Modify the query in the right hand side to load the correct data from your wandb logs. Add the field \u201csummaryTable\u201d and set the corresponding \u201ctableKey\u201d to \u201cclass\\_scores\u201d to fetch the wandb.Table logged by your run. This will let you populate the two histogram bin sets (\u201cred\\_bins\u201d and \u201cblue\\_bins\u201d) via the dropdown menus with the columns of the wandb.Table logged as \u201cclass\\_scores\u201d. For my example, I chose the \u201canimal\u201d class prediction scores for the red bins and \u201cplant\u201d for the blue bins.\n4. You can keep making changes to the Vega spec and query until you\u2019re happy with the plot you see in the preview rendering. Once you\u2019re done, click \u201cSave as\u201d in the top and give your custom plot a name so you can reuse it. Then click \u201cApply from panel library\u201d to finish your plot.\n\nHere\u2019s what my results look like from a very brief experiment: training on only 1000 examples for one epoch yields a model that\u2019s very confident that most images are not plants and very uncertain about which images might be animals.\n\n![](https://paper-attachments.dropbox.com/s\\_5FCA7E5A968820ADD0CD5402B4B0F71ED90882B3AC586103C1A96\n***\nYou will now generate a user question and corresponding answer based on the above document. \nFirst, explain the user context and what problems they might be trying to solve. \nSecond, generate user question. \nThird, provide the accurate and concise answer in markdown format to the user question using the documentation. \nYou'll be evaluated on:\n- how realistic is that this question will come from a real user one day? \n- is this question about W&B? \n- can the question be answered using the W&B document fragment above? \n- how accurate is the answer?\nRemember that users have different styles and can be imprecise.

Create a new Custom Chart panel in your Workspace or Report by adding a \"Custom Chart\" visualization.\n2. Click on the \"Edit\" button in the top right corner to modify the Vega spec for the panel.\n3.

Populate the two histogram bin sets (\"red_bins\" and \"blue_bins\") via the dropdown menus with the columns of the wandb.Table logged as \"class_scores\". For your case, you can choose the respective class prediction scores.\n7. Continue making changes to the Vega spec and query until you're satisfied with the plot in the preview rendering.\n8.
