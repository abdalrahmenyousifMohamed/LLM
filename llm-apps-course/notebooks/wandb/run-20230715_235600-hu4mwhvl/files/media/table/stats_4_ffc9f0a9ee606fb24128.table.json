Instantiate the `WandbLogger` and pass it to Lightning's `Trainer` as the `logger` argument. You can do this by adding the following code:\n\n   ```python\n   wandb_logger = WandbLogger()\n   trainer = Trainer(logger=wandb_logger)\n   ```\n\n   This will set up WandbLogger to log metrics, model weights, and media.\n\n   You can also customize the logging behavior using various parameters of the `WandbLogger`. Examples include:\n   \n   - `project`: Define what Wandb project to log to.\n   - `name`: Give a name to your Wandb run.\n   - `log_model`: Log all models if `log_model=\"all\"` or at the end of training if `log_model=True`.\n   - `save_dir`: Path where data is saved.\n\nPlease refer to the [WandbLogger documentation](https://pytorch-lightning.readthedocs.io/en/latest/extensions/generated/pytorch_lightning.loggers.WandbLogger.html?highlight=wandblogger) for a full list and description of the available parameters.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:07:28", "2023-07-16T01:07:46.158437", "chatcmpl-7chiCPZiHRqjfYTfdHcMzNO3zNa1t", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 18.1584372909997, 883, 1227, 2110]]}
