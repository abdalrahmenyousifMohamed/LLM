How can I load this checkpoint to continue my training or use the saved model for inference?\n\nANSWER: To load a checkpoint in W&B, you can use the `wandb.use_artifact()` method. Here's an example of how to do it:\n\n```python\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"MNIST\")\nartifact = run.use_artifact(checkpoint_reference, type=\"model\")\nartifact_dir = artifact.download()\n\nmodel = LitModule.load_from_checkpoint(Path(artifact_dir) / \"model.ckpt\")\n```\n\nIn this example, the `checkpoint_reference` is the reference to the artifact containing your saved model checkpoint. You can obtain this reference from the W&B interface or programmatically.\n\nThe `use_artifact()` method allows you to fetch the artifact from W&B, and the `download()` method downloads it locally. Finally, you can use `LitModule.load_from_checkpoint()` to load the model checkpoint from the downloaded artifact directory.\n\nNow you can continue training your model or use it for inference.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:14:55", "2023-07-16T01:15:08.928134", "chatcmpl-7chpPYcw9IZbmGNiuV4bSFJn7z6mI", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 13.928133750000143, 902, 1597, 2499], ["\n\n**system**: You are a creative assistant with the goal to generate a synthetic dataset of Weights & Biases (W&B) user questions.\nW&B users are asking these questions to a bot, so they don't know the answer and their questions are grounded in what they're trying to achieve. \nWe are interested in questions that can be answered by W&B documentation. \nBut the users don't have access to this documentation, so you need to imagine what they're trying to do and use according language.\n\n\n**user**: Here are some examples of real user questions, you will be judged by how well you match this distribution.\n***\ncan I use the column subsample parameter config file for xgboost parameters through sweeps?\nI have an config file apart from sweep_config file so when I try to run sweep agent, I am getting UnboundLocalError(\"local variable 'config' referenced before assignment\").\nare you still here?\n***\nIn the next step, you will read a fragment of W&B documentation.\nThis will serve as inspiration for synthetic user question and the source of the answer. \nHere is the document fragment:\n***\n = \"USER/PROJECT/MODEL-RUN_ID:VERSION\"\n\n# download checkpoint locally (if not already cached)\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"MNIST\")\nartifact = run.use_artifact(checkpoint_reference, type=\"model\")\nartifact_dir = artifact.download()\n\n# load checkpoint\nmodel = LitModule.load_from_checkpoint(Path(artifact_dir) / \"model.ckpt\")\n```\n\n### Log images, text and more\n\nThe `WandbLogger` has `log_image`, `log_text` and `log_table` methods for logging media.\n\nYou can also directly call `wandb.log` or `trainer.logger.experiment.log` to log other media types such as Audio, Molecules, Point Clouds, 3D Objects and more.\n\n\n\n<Tabs\n  defaultValue=\"images\"\n  values={[\n    {label: 'Log Images', value: 'images'},\n    {label: 'Log Text', value: 'text'},\n    {label: 'Log Tables', value: 'tables'},\n  ]}>\n  <TabItem value=\"images\">\n\n```python\n# using tensors, numpy arrays or PIL images\nwandb_logger.log_image(key=\"samples\", images=[img1, img2])\n\n# adding captions\nwandb_logger.log_image(key=\"samples\", images=[img1, img2], caption=[\"tree\", \"person\"])\n\n# using file path\nwandb_logger.log_image(key=\"samples\", images=[\"img_1.jpg\", \"img_2.jpg\"])\n\n# using .log in the trainer\ntrainer.logger.experiment.log({\n    \"samples\": [wandb.Image(img, caption=caption) \n    for (img, caption) in my_images]\n})\n```\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"text\">\n\n```python\n# data should be a list of lists\ncolumns = [\"input\", \"label\", \"prediction\"]\nmy_data = [[\"cheese\", \"english\", \"english\"], [\"fromage\", \"french\", \"spanish\"]]\n\n# using columns and data\nwandb_logger.log_text(key=\"my_samples\", columns=columns, data=my_data)\n\n# using a pandas DataFrame\nwandb_logger.log_text(key=\"my_samples\", dataframe=my_dataframe)\n```\n\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"tables\">\n\n```python\n# log a W&B Table that has a text caption, an image and audio\ncolumns = [\"caption\", \"image\", \"sound\"]\n\n# data should be a list of lists\nmy_data = [[\"cheese\", wandb\n***\nYou will now generate a user question and corresponding answer based on the above document. \nFirst, explain the user context and what problems they might be trying to solve. \nSecond, generate user question. \nThird, provide the accurate and concise answer in markdown format to the user question using the documentation. \nYou'll be evaluated on:\n- how realistic is that this question will come from a real user one day? \n- is this question about W&B? \n- can the question be answered using the W&B document fragment above? \n- how accurate is the answer?\nRemember that users have different styles and can be imprecise.

This method allows you to log images with captions by providing the `key`, `images`, and `caption` parameters.

You can create a list of `wandb.Image` objects, where each object represents an image with its corresponding caption, and pass this list to the `.log` method.\n\nHere is an example of how to log images with captions using the `.log` method:\n\n```python\ntrainer.logger.experiment.log({\n    \"samples\": [wandb.Image(img, caption=caption) for (img, caption) in my_images]\n})\n```\n\nBy using either the `wandb.log_image` method or the `.log` method with `wandb.Image` objects, you can easily log images with captions during the training process in W&B.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:14:55", "2023-07-16T01:15:08.928134", "chatcmpl-7chpPYcw9IZbmGNiuV4bSFJn7z6mI", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 13.928133750000143, 902, 1597, 2499], ["\n\n**system**: You are a creative assistant with the goal to generate a synthetic dataset of Weights & Biases (W&B) user questions.\nW&B users are asking these questions to a bot, so they don't know the answer and their questions are grounded in what they're trying to achieve. \nWe are interested in questions that can be answered by W&B documentation. \nBut the users don't have access to this documentation, so you need to imagine what they're trying to do and use according language.\n\n\n**user**: Here are some examples of real user questions, you will be judged by how well you match this distribution.\n***\ncan I use the column subsample parameter config file for xgboost parameters through sweeps?\nI have an config file apart from sweep_config file so when I try to run sweep agent, I am getting UnboundLocalError(\"local variable 'config' referenced before assignment\").\nare you still here?\n***\nIn the next step, you will read a fragment of W&B documentation.\nThis will serve as inspiration for synthetic user question and the source of the answer. \nHere is the document fragment:\n***\n = \"USER/PROJECT/MODEL-RUN_ID:VERSION\"\n\n# download checkpoint locally (if not already cached)\nrun = wandb.init(project=\"MNIST\")\nartifact = run.use_artifact(checkpoint_reference, type=\"model\")\nartifact_dir = artifact.download()\n\n# load checkpoint\nmodel = LitModule.load_from_checkpoint(Path(artifact_dir) / \"model.ckpt\")\n```\n\n### Log images, text and more\n\nThe `WandbLogger` has `log_image`, `log_text` and `log_table` methods for logging media.\n\nYou can also directly call `wandb.log` or `trainer.logger.experiment.log` to log other media types such as Audio, Molecules, Point Clouds, 3D Objects and more.\n\n\n\n<Tabs\n  defaultValue=\"images\"\n  values={[\n    {label: 'Log Images', value: 'images'},\n    {label: 'Log Text', value: 'text'},\n    {label: 'Log Tables', value: 'tables'},\n  ]}>\n  <TabItem value=\"images\">\n\n```python\n# using tensors, numpy arrays or PIL images\nwandb_logger.log_image(key=\"samples\", images=[img1, img2])\n\n# adding captions\nwandb_logger.log_image(key=\"samples\", images=[img1, img2], caption=[\"tree\", \"person\"])\n\n# using file path\nwandb_logger.log_image(key=\"samples\", images=[\"img_1.jpg\", \"img_2.jpg\"])\n\n# using .log in the trainer\ntrainer.logger.experiment.log({\n    \"samples\": [wandb.Image(img, caption=caption) \n    for (img, caption) in my_images]\n})\n```\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"text\">\n\n```python\n# data should be a list of lists\ncolumns = [\"input\", \"label\", \"prediction\"]\nmy_data = [[\"cheese\", \"english\", \"english\"], [\"fromage\", \"french\", \"spanish\"]]\n\n# using columns and data\nwandb_logger.log_text(key=\"my_samples\", columns=columns, data=my_data)\n\n# using a pandas DataFrame\nwandb_logger.log_text(key=\"my_samples\", dataframe=my_dataframe)\n```\n\n  </TabItem>\n  <TabItem value=\"tables\">\n\n```python\n# log a W&B Table that has a text caption, an image and audio\ncolumns = [\"caption\", \"image\", \"sound\"]\n\n# data should be a list of lists\nmy_data = [[\"cheese\", wandb\n***\nYou will now generate a user question and corresponding answer based on the above document. \nFirst, explain the user context and what problems they might be trying to solve. \nSecond, generate user question. \nThird, provide the accurate and concise answer in markdown format to the user question using the documentation. \nYou'll be evaluated on:\n- how realistic is that this question will come from a real user one day? \n- is this question about W&B? \n- can the question be answered using the W&B document fragment above? \n- how accurate is the answer?\nRemember that users have different styles and can be imprecise.

For example, to log Audio, you can use:\n```python\nwandb.log({\"audio\": wandb.Audio(audio_data, caption=\"example audio\")})\n```\nTo log Molecules, you can use:\n```python\nwandb.log({\"molecules\": wandb.Molecules(molecule_data, caption=\"example molecule\")})\n```\nTo log Point Clouds, you can use:\n```python\nwandb.log({\"point_clouds\": wandb.Object3D(point_cloud_data, caption=\"example point cloud\")})\n```\nAnd to log 3D Objects, you can use:\n```python\nwandb.log({\"objects\": wandb.Object3D(object_data, caption=\"example 3D object\")})\n```\nMake sure to replace `audio_data`, `molecule_data`, `point_cloud_data`, and `object_data` with the respective data for each media type.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:14:55", "2023-07-16T01:15:08.928134", "chatcmpl-7chpPYcw9IZbmGNiuV4bSFJn7z6mI", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 13.928133750000143, 902, 1597, 2499]]}
