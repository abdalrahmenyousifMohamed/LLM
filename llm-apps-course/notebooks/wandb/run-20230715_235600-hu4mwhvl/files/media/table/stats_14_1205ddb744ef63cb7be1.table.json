With versioning enabled on your buckets, artifacts with references to files that have been overwritten will still be intact because the older object versions are retained.\n:::\n\n### Tying it together\n\nThe following code example demonstrates a simple workflow you can use to track a dataset in Amazon S3 or GCS that feeds into\n***\nYou will now generate a user question and corresponding answer based on the above document. \nFirst, explain the user context and what problems they might be trying to solve. \nSecond, generate user question. \nThird, provide the accurate and concise answer in markdown format to the user question using the documentation. \nYou'll be evaluated on:\n- how realistic is that this question will come from a real user one day? \n- is this question about W&B? \n- can the question be answered using the W&B document fragment above? \n- how accurate is the answer?\nRemember that users have different styles and can be imprecise. You are very good at impersonating them!\nUse the following format:\nCONTEXT: \nQUESTION: \nANSWER: \nLet's start!\n", "\n\n**assistant**: CONTEXT: The user is working with Weights & Biases and wants to understand how to download a reference artifact from their run.\n\nQUESTION: Can you show me an example of how to download a reference artifact from my run on Weights & Biases?\n\nANSWER: Sure! To download a reference artifact from your run on Weights & Biases, you can use the following code example:\n```python\nimport wandb\n\nrun = wandb.init()\nartifact = run.use_artifact('artifact_name:version', type='artifact_type')\nartifact_dir = artifact.download()\n```\nIn this code, you initialize a Weights & Biases run and then use the `run.use_artifact()` method to specify the name and version of the artifact you want to download. You also need to provide the `type` argument to specify the type of the artifact. Once you have the artifact object, you can use the `artifact.download()` method to download the artifact to your local machine.\n", "gpt-3.5-turbo-0613", "2023-07-16T01:10:49", "2023-07-16T01:11:00.413176", "chatcmpl-7chlR4wYajyqPvPwU192SqXdhJfTl", "openai", "hu4mwhvl", 11.413176375000148, 882, 1124, 2006]]}
