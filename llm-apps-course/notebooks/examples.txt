is there a W&B integration for AutoKeras?	Hi. 
I'm running a sweep on some hyper-parameter (let's say learning_rate).
 In each run, I  obtain two lists of length 10 : (1) validation set rewards and (2) test set rewards.

for evaluation purposes. 
This  happens after wandb.finish() has been called. I don't want any further logging.  _rollout performs a rollout of the environment and returns a tuple containing the return and the length of the episode. Policy is nn.module wrapped into a lambda function to handle conversion between numpy and torch. Update normalization is not important here.
The unwrapped policy module has been passed to the wand watch function.
Now when i run this loop with num_runs <= 3 it works as intended but when I run it with a higher value i get the following error:
