"A user might be trying to train an image classification model using PyTorch and logging the results with W&B.
","I'm building an image classification model using PyTorch and I want to log my training and validation loss and accuracy using W&B. Can anyone tell me how to configure my PyTorch model and use W&B to log my metrics?
","You can use the PyTorch lightning integration for W&B and follow the following steps to configure your PyTorch model and log training and validation loss and accuracy.

1. Define your PyTorch model and inherit from `pl.LightningModule`.
2. Implement the `forward` method to define your neural network.
3. Implement the `training_step` method to calculate loss and log the training loss and accuracy. Remember to call `self.log` function to log your metrics.
4. Implement the `validation_step` method to calculate loss and accuracy and log your metrics.
5. Implement the `configure_optimizers` method to define your optimizer.
6. Use `wandb.init()` to initialize your W&B run.
7. Use `wandb_logger = WandbLogger()` to define a W&B logger.
8. Use `trainer = pl.Trainer(logger=wandb_logger)` to define your PyTorch Lightning trainer and pass the W&B logger.
9. Call `trainer.fit(model)` to train your model and log your metrics to W&B.

You can also define your metric using `wandb.define_metric` to specify the summary visualization and the min/max direction to match your needs."
"A user is trying to understand the code for a neural network model that was trained using Weights & Biases and saved on the W&B cloud. They want to know how to download this trained model and load it to make predictions on new data.
","How can I export a trained model from Weights & Biases cloud and load it to make predictions on new data?
","To download your trained model from Weights & Biases cloud, you can use W&B Artifacts. First, download the latest version of the model artifact by running `artifact = run.use_artifact('<artifact_name>:latest')`, where `<artifact_name>` is the name you gave to the model artifact when you logged it during training. Then you can download the artifact files by running `artifact.download()`, which will download all the files in the artifact directory to your local machine. To load the model, you can use the PyTorch `load_state_dict()` method and pass it the state dictionary saved during training. Here's an example:

```
import torch
from model import MyModel

# Create an instance of your model architecture
model = MyModel()

# Download the latest version of the model artifact
artifact = run.use_artifact('<artifact_name>:latest')
artifact.download()

# Load the state dictionary saved during training
state_dict = torch.load('artifact_dir/path/to/state_dict.pt')

# Load the state_dict into your model
model.load_state_dict(state_dict)
```

After loading the saved model, you can use it to make predictions on new data by passing your inputs through the model's `forward()` method."
"A user is building a neural network model for image classification using PyTorch and Weights & Biases. They have defined the model parameters, configured the optimizer, and defined the training and validation steps using PyTorch Lightning. They want to log the minimum and maximum values of their metric during training to track their progress.
","How can I use W&B to track the min and max of my metric during training?
","You can use the `define_metric` function from Weights & Biases to define a custom metric that logs the minimum and maximum values of your metric during training. Here's an example of how you can use this function in your training loop:

```python
import wandb

# define your metric
metric = wandb.define_metric(""my_metric"", summary=""min_max"")

# in your training loop
for epoch in range(num_epochs):
    for batch in dataloader:
        # ... your training code here

        # log your metric
        metric.update(min=min_value, max=max_value)
        wandb.log({""my_metric"": metric})
```

This will log the minimum and maximum values of your metric during training as a summary value in your W&B run. You can visualize this in the W&B dashboard to track your progress over time."
"A deep learning engineer is building a convolutional neural network (CNN) to recognize handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset using PyTorch and Weights & Biases. They want to keep track of training and validation losses, as well as their model's accuracy, and log them on W&B.","What is the function of the `self.log()` method in PyTorch Lightning, and how can I use it to log my losses and accuracy in W&B?","The `self.log()` method is used to log information related to the training or validation step, which is then automatically logged to W&B. You can use it to log losses and accuracy by passing the name of the metric as the first argument, and the value as the second argument. For example, in the `training_step()` method, you can log the training loss and accuracy with `self.log('train_loss', loss)` and `self.log('train_accuracy', acc)`. Similarly, in the `validation_step()` method, you can log the validation loss and accuracy with `self.log('val_loss', loss)` and `self.log('val_accuracy', acc)`."
"A user is training a neural network using PyTorch and tracking their experiments with W&B. They are interested in logging the minimum and maximum value of their validation accuracy during training.
","How can I use W&B to log the minimum and maximum values of validation accuracy during training?
","You can use wandb's `define_metric` function to define whether you'd like your W&B summary metric to display the min or max value. Once you have defined your metric, you can log `val_accuracy` in the `validation_step` method of your PyTorch Lightning `LightningModule`. The `val_accuracy` will be automatically tracked and you can visualize the min and max values in your W&B dashboard. Here is an example code snippet:

```

"The user is interested in setting up a sweep configuration in Weights & Biases to optimize hyperparameters for a machine learning model. They have heard about sweeps but are not sure about the specifics and want to know how to start using them in their project.
","Hi there! I have been working on a machine learning project and I am interested in using sweeps to optimize my hyperparameters. Can you explain to me how to set up a sweep configuration in Weights & Biases?
","Sure thing! Setting up a sweep configuration in Weights & Biases is a simple process. Within a dictionary, you need to specify which hyperparameters you want to sweep over. Then you define the metric you want to maximize or minimize, and specify the optimization method you want to use for the sweep. Finally, you initialize the sweep and start running it with `wandb.agent`. You can easily visualize the results of your sweep in the W&B Sweep dashboard. For more detailed information on how to set up and run a sweep, please visit [Initialize sweeps](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/initialize-sweeps)."
"The user is trying to understand how W&B sweeps work and how to create a sweep with a random search method. They want to know how to initialize and start a sweep from the W&B documentation.
","What is a sweep identification number and how do I get it?
","A sweep identification number is a unique identifier for a sweep. You can get the sweep identification number by initializing a sweep with the desired configuration options using the `wandb.sweep` function. The function returns the sweep identification number, which you can use for starting the sweep. For example, the following code initializes a sweep:
```python
sweep_id = wandb.sweep(sweep=sweep_configuration, project='my-first-sweep')
```
where `sweep_configuration` is a dictionary containing the configuration options for the sweep, and `'my-first-sweep'` is the name of the project for the sweep. Once the sweep is initialized, you can use the `sweep_id` to start the sweep with the `wandb.agent` function."
"A user is trying to set up a search space sweep using Weights & Biases and is confused about how to initialize it.
","How do I start a sweep with Weights & Biases?
","To initialize a sweep with Weights & Biases, you need to first specify the hyperparameters you want to sweep over within a dictionary, then use the Sweep Controller to manage the sweep on the cloud or locally across one or more machines. To initialize a sweep, use the `wandb.sweep` API call to specify the sweep configuration and the project name. This will return a sweep identification number. Then, use the `wandb.agent` API call to start the sweep and execute the function on the specified number of runs. For more information about how to initialize and start sweeps, see [Initialize sweeps](https://docs.wandb.ai/guides/sweeps/initialize-sweeps) and [Search and stop algorithms locally](./local-controller.md)."
"The user is trying to optimize hyperparameters for their deep learning model. They are interested in using W&B sweep functionality to automate their hyperparameter search process. They want to know what happens to the metric during a sweep and how to visualize their results.
","How does W&B select the best set of hyperparameters during a sweep, and what is the default metric used to evaluate the performance of different models? How can I visualize my results after a sweep?
","
During a sweep, W&B tries to maximize or minimize a metric that you specify in the metric key. In our example, it is validation accuracy and minimal value (`'goal':'maximize'`). W&B compares the metric values for all runs and selects the ones that outperformed others according to the goal. You can also choose other metrics to optimize over, like loss or F1-score. 

To visualize your sweep results, you can use the W&B Sweep dashboard. With just a few clicks, construct rich, interactive charts like parallel coordinates plots, parameter importance analyzes, and more. To open the dashboard, open your project, choose the sweep of interest, and click on ""Sweep"" in the project panel."
"A user is working with W&B sweep configurations and wants to know how to track the sweep runs and their respective metrics.
","How can I track my sweep runs and the metrics associated with each run?
","To track your sweep runs and the corresponding metrics, use the `wandb.Sweep()` function to initialize a new sweep with a specified configuration. This function returns a sweep ID which can be used to start the sweep and log data for each run. Use the `wandb.agent()` function to start the sweep and log metrics for each run. W&B will automatically organize and visualize the sweep results in the sweep dashboard."
"A user is working on a data science project with a team and frequently making changes to their dataset. They want to know how they can version their data and keep track of changes.
","How can I version my datasets and keep track of changes in W&B?
","In W&B, you can version your datasets using artifacts. When you make changes to your dataset, just re-run the artifact creation script and W&B will automatically create a new version with a unique identifier. You can also tag artifact versions with custom aliases, take notes on what changed, store metadata alongside each version, and see which experiment runs use a particular version. This helps keep your team working with the latest or a stable version of the data. To log an artifact, you can initialize a wandb run with the `job_type=""dataset-creation""` argument and then log the artifact using `run.log_artifact(artifact)`. Check out our documentation on [Datasets & Predictions](https://docs.wandb.ai/datasets-and-predictions) to learn more about artifact versioning in W&B."
"A user is working with a large dataset for their machine learning project, and they have made several changes to the dataset over time.

","How can I keep track of changes to my dataset and easily manage different versions of it in W&B?
","W&B allows you to easily manage different versions of your dataset by automatically versioning artifacts. You can tag artifact versions with custom aliases, take notes on what changed, store metadata alongside each version, and see which experiment runs use a particular version. This way, you can be sure you're working with the latest or a stable version of the data. To log an artifact, you can use the following code:

```

By adding descriptions and metadata to your datasets, you can easily keep track of changes and the purpose of your datasets."
"A data scientist is working on creating a new version of a dataset and wants to know how to tag the new version and add metadata to it for future reference.
","How can I tag a new version of my dataset in W&B and add metadata to it for future reference?
","To tag a new version of your dataset in W&B, you can log the updated dataset as a new artifact using the `log_artifact` function and giving it a custom name. For example, if you updated your ""nature-dataset"", you can create a new artifact with the name ""nature-dataset-v2"" and log it with `run.log_artifact(artifact, aliases=[""latest""])`. You can then add metadata to this new artifact by calling the `add_metadata` function and passing in a dictionary of key-value pairs. For instance, to add the date when the data was updated and a note about the changes made, you can use `artifact.add_metadata({""date_updated"":""2022-03-08"", ""notes"":""removed mislabeled examples from animal-ids.txt""})`. This way, you can easily access and identify this new version of your dataset in the future, and your team can have a clear understanding of what changes were made."

","Hey W&B bot, I'm working on a project that requires multiple datasets and I need to keep track of any changes I make. I was wondering if there's an easy way to version the datasets and maybe add some notes about the changes?
","Yes, absolutely! Weights & Biases allows you to tag artifact versions with custom aliases, take notes on what changed, store metadata alongside each version, and see which experiment runs use a particular version. You can also give your datasets custom names and annotate them with notes or key-value pair metadata. This way, you can easily keep track of the changes made to each version of your data, while preserving the lineage and history of previous changes."

A user is running a PyTorch model with Weight & Biases integrated and wants to know the best way to log the model's weights and gradients to W&B.
","
How can I log the weights and gradients of my PyTorch model to W&B using the Wandb.watch() function?
","
To log the weights and gradients of your PyTorch model to W&B, you can use the `wandb.watch()` function. This function automatically logs gradients, weights, topology, and more. In the given code fragment, `wandb.watch()` is called to log the model and gradients to W&B. To activate logging for all features, `log=""all""` is added. If you only want to log gradients, you can use `log=""gradients""`. If you want to log all histogrammed tensors, you can use `log=""histogram""`. Finally, to log the network topology, you can use `log_graph=True`. 

Here is a code example:

```
wandb.watch(model, log=""all"", log_graph=True)
```

This code should be added just before the epoch loop. With this line, your PyTorch model's weights and gradients will be successfully logged to W&B."
"A user is training a deep learning model using PyTorch and W&B and they want to monitor the training process. They have already initialized a W&B project and logged in using their API key.
","How do I monitor the model's gradients during training using WandB?
","You can use the `wandb.watch()` function to monitor your model's gradients during training. It takes as input your PyTorch model and logs the gradients for all parameters, along with the parameter values and the forward and backward pass of the computation graph. In the code fragment you provided, `wandb.watch()` is used to log the model, gradients, and topology to W&B."
"A user is trying to understand how to use the wandb watch functionality to log gradients and weights for their PyTorch model during training.
","How do I activate logging of network topology using wandb.watch() while training my PyTorch model with Weights & Biases?
","To activate logging of network topology using wandb.watch() while training your PyTorch model with Weights & Biases, you need to provide the `log` argument with `'all'` parameter to the `wandb.watch()` function. This will automatically log gradients, weights, topology and more. In the documentation fragment provided, you can see `wandb.watch(model, log=""all"", log_graph=True)`. This means Weights & Biases is logging all relevant information needed for debugging and optimization purposes, including network topology."
"A user is trying to log the accuracy of their image classification model while training it using PyTorch. They are using Weights & Biases for experiment tracking and visualization.
","How can I log the accuracy of my PyTorch image classification model using Wandb?
","To log the accuracy of your PyTorch image classification model using Wandb, you can use `wandb.log` to log the average accuracy and `wandb.log` inside the validation loop to log the accuracy for each batch. Here's an example of how to do it:

```
# Inside the validation loop
with torch.no_grad():
    correct = 0
    total = 0
    for images, labels in test_loader:
        images = images.to(device)
        labels = labels.to(device)
        outputs = model(images)
        _, predicted = torch.max(outputs.data, 1)
        total += labels.size(0)
        correct += (predicted == labels).sum().item()

    accuracy = 100 * correct / total
    wandb.log({""valid/acc"": accuracy})
    
# Outside the validation loop
wandb.log({""valid/avg_acc"": sum(accuracies) / len(accuracies)})
``` 

Note that this assumes you have already set up logging in your PyTorch code using `wandb.init`. If you haven't done that yet, you can find more information in the Wandb documentation."
"A user is training a PyTorch model using Weights & Biases and is trying to log certain metrics during training.
","How do I log the total number of parameters in my PyTorch model using Weights & Biases?
","To log the total number of parameters in your PyTorch model using Weights & Biases, you can use the wandb.watch() function to automatically log the architecture and gradients of your model. After calling wandb.watch(), you can access the number of parameters in your model by calling the wandb.summary.num_parameters() function. Here is an example:

```
import torch

1. Log a new table with the same key as the original table, and the new data will be appended to the existing table in the workspace.
2. Download the original table as a Pandas DataFrame using `wandb.Table(columns, data).to_dataframe()`. Append the new data to the DataFrame, and log the entire updated table using `wandb.Table.from_dataframe(new_dataframe)` with the same key as before."
"A user is trying to log data tables and visualize them in W&B.

Then, when you navigate to the W&B App and select the name of your Project in the workspace, you should see a panel with a list of tables displayed. Click on the table you want to compare, and then select ""Group By"" to group the data according to specific columns. You can also filter the displayed data by selecting ""Filter"" and choosing a column along with the relevant values. With these features, you can compare specific columns of tables across runs, making it easy to analyze and compare model performance across different configurations."

A W&B user has worked on a machine learning project and wants to apply tags to a new run created using their code. They have seen that in the W&B documentation there are different ways to apply tags, but they are not sure which method is the most suitable for their case. 
","Hi wandbot, I want to apply tags to my new run. Should I use the Public API, the Project Page, or the Run Page?
","To apply tags to your new run, you can use either the Public API, the Project Page, or the Run Page, depending on your needs. If you want to apply a tag to a large number of runs, the Project Page method is most suitable. If you want to apply a tag to a single run by hand, the Run Page method is recommended. If you prefer to use code, the Public API method is your best choice. You can find detailed instructions on how to apply tags using each method in the W&B documentation.

For the Public API method, you can follow these steps:

1. Import the wandb module and authenticate your API credentials.

```python
import wandb
wandb.login()
```

2. Get the run with the specified id using the Api() method.

```python
run = wandb.Api().run(""{entity}/{project}/{run-id}"")
```

3. Append the tag to the run using the tags attribute.

```python
run.tags.append(""tag1"")
```

4. Finally, update the run using the update() method.

```python
run.update()
```

For the Project Page method, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the runs sidebar on the Project Page.

2. Click the table icon in the upper-right corner to expand the sidebar into the full runs table.

3. Hover over a run in the table to see a checkbox on the left or look in the header row for a checkbox that will allow you to select all runs.

4. Click the checkbox to enable bulk actions. Select the runs to which you'd like to apply your tag(s).

5. Click the Tag button above the rows of runs.

6. Type the tag you'd like to add and click ""Add"" below the text box to add a new tag.

For the Run Page method, you can follow these steps:

1. Open the Run Page for the run you want to add tags to.

2. Click the Overview tab on the left sidebar.

3. Click the gray + button next to ""Tags"".

4. Type the tag you'd like to add and click ""Add"" below the text box to add a new tag."

Hover over a run in the table to see a checkbox on the left or look in the header row for a checkbox that will allow you to select all runs. Click the checkbox to enable bulk actions. Select the runs to which you'd like to apply your tag(s), then click the Tag button above the runs. Type a tag you'd like to add and click ""Add"" below the text box to add it to the selected runs.

To remove tags from multiple runs in bulk, follow the same steps as above for adding tags, but instead of adding tags, click ""Remove"" next to the tag you'd like to remove from the selected runs."
"A user is training multiple versions of a Machine Learning model and wants to keep track of them. They have heard about Model Artifacts, Model Versions, and Registered Models with Weights & Biases, but they are not sure how to use them.
","Hi! I have trained different versions of a Machine Learning model and I want to organize them and keep track of each version. I heard about Model Artifacts, Model Versions, and Registered Models with Weights & Biases, but I'm not sure which one to use for my purpose. Can you help me?
","Sure! In W&B, a **Model Artifact** is a sequence of Model Versions, and each individual model being trained by the Run corresponds to its own Model Artifact, and each checkpoint corresponds to its own Model Version of the respective Model Artifact.

To keep track of each version, you can create Model Versions for your trained models. A **Model Version** is an immutable directory of data, that typically stores whatever files are produced from the serialization process provided by your modeling library. For instance, if you are using PyTorch you can store the learned parameters using `torch.save(model.state_dict(), PATH)`. If you are using Keras you can use `model.save(filepath)`. You can then create a Model Version using `wandb.Artifact(""model-version"", type=""model"")` and add each file to the artifact using `artifact.add_file(PATH_TO_FILE)`. Finally, you can save the artifact using `run.log_artifact(artifact)`.

If you want to organize your Model Versions and create ""bookmarks"" to versions that have specific purposes, you can use a **Registered Model**. A Registered Model is a set of links to Model Versions, and each ""version"" of a Registered Model is actually a link to a Model Version belonging to a Model Artifact of the same type. You typically create a Registered Model for each of your use cases or modeling tasks and use aliases like ""production"" or ""staging"" to denote versions with special purposes."
"A user is working on training multiple versions of a machine learning model and wants to keep track of each version and its training progress. They are interested in using W&B for version control and tracking performance metrics for each model version.
","Hi there, I'm training multiple versions of my machine learning model and want to use W&B for version control. Can you explain what a Model Version is in W&B?
","

Sure! In W&B, a Model Version is an immutable directory of data containing the learned parameters and architecture of a machine learning model. Each Model Version is identified by a unique hash and each hash corresponds to a specific version of the model. You have the flexibility to decide what files and formats are appropriate to store and restore your model's architecture and parameters. Typically, you will want to store whatever files are produced from the serialization process provided by your modeling library. For example, if you're using PyTorch for model training, you will save the model checkpoint to a file using the `torch.save()` function. This saved checkpoint can then be stored in the Model Version directory."
A user is trying to organize their ML models and keep track of their versions using W&B.,I have created several different W&B runs that produced different versions of my trained models. How can I group them together and keep track of their versions?,"You can group your different model versions together using a Model Artifact in W&B. A Model Artifact consists of a sequence of Model Versions and can alias specific versions so that downstream consumers can pin to such aliases. You can create a Model Artifact for each individual model being trained by the run and each checkpoint corresponding to its own Model Version of the respective Model Artifact. Once you have created a Model Artifact, you can link it with a Registered Model, which is a set of links to Model Versions. A Registered Model can be accessed like a Model Artifact and acts like a folder of bookmarks, where each version of the Registered Model is actually a link to a Model Version belonging to a Model Artifact of the same type. You can create a Registered Model for each of your use cases or modeling tasks and use aliases like ""production"" or ""staging"" to denote versions with special purposes."
"A user is trying to understand how to manage their model artifacts in W&B. They want to know how to create and access a registered model.
","How do I create and access a registered model in W&B?
","

You can create and access a registered model in W&B by following these steps:
1. First, create a Model Artifact by defining its type as `type=""model""`.
2. Save your model architecture & learned parameters in the directory along with any additional files you want to include.
3. Upload the created Model Artifact to W&B using the W&B API.
4. Create a Registered Model by using the `wandb.artifacts.create()` method and passing it the entity name, project name, and registered model name.
5. Finally, link the Model Versions to the Registered Model using `wandb.Artifact.add()`. 

You can access the Registered Model exactly like the Model Artifact, identified by `[[entityName/]/projectName]/registeredModelName:versionAlias`. For example:

```
import wandb

# create a new Model Artifact
artifact = wandb.Artifact(""my-model"", type=""model"")
artifact.add_file(""model.h5"")
artifact.add_file(""README.md"")

# upload the artifact to W&B
run.log_artifact(artifact)

# create a new Registered Model and link it to the Model Artifact
rm = wandb.artifacts.create_registered_model(""my-registered-model"", ""description"")
rm.add_version(artifact, ""v0"")
rm.alias(""production"", ""v0"")

# access the registered model
reg_model_ref = ""[[entityName/]/projectName]/my-registered-model:production""
reg_model = wandb.use_artifact(reg_model_ref)
v0 = reg_model.get(""my-model:v0"")
```"

"A user has been working on a machine learning project that involves tracking a dataset in Amazon S3 or GCS that feeds into a training job. They have read the Weights & Biases documentation about reference artifacts, but they are not sure how to tie everything together.
","How can I make sure that my model is trained on the exact iteration of my data that I want it to be trained on, even as I evolve the contents of my bucket?
","Weights & Biases uses the metadata recorded when the artifact was logged to retrieve the files from the underlying bucket when it downloads a reference artifact. If your bucket has object versioning enabled, Weights & Biases will retrieve the object version corresponding to the state of the file at the time an artifact was logged. This means that as you evolve the contents of your bucket, you can still point to the exact iteration of your data a given model was trained on since the artifact serves as a snapshot of your bucket at the time of training.

In order to track a dataset in Amazon S3 or GCS that feeds into a training job, you can first create a new artifact using `wandb.Artifact()`. Then, you can add a reference to your dataset using `artifact.add_reference()`, specifying the path to your data in your bucket. Finally, you can log the artifact using `run.log_artifact()` to upload it to Weights & Biases. When it comes time to use the dataset for training, you can call `run.use_artifact()` to download the artifact and retrieve a local copy of your dataset as it existed at the time of training. Weights & Biases recommends that you enable 'Object Versioning' on your Amazon S3 or GCS buckets if you overwrite files as part of your workflow to ensure that artifacts with references to files that have been overwritten will still be intact because the older object versions are retained."
"A user is working with reference artifacts in Weights & Biases, trying to download a dataset from Amazon S3 or GCS to use in a training job. They have encountered some issues and are seeking help.
","I keep getting the error message ""no matching artifact found"" when trying to download a reference artifact from S3 bucket. What could be the possible reasons for this error?
","
There are several possible reasons why you are seeing the ""no matching artifact found"" error when attempting to download a reference artifact from an S3 bucket. One possible reason is that the artifact may have been deleted from the bucket, so it is no longer available for download. Another possible reason is that the bucket policy may be misconfigured, preventing Weights & Biases from reading the artifact. You can try checking the AWS policy that controls access to the S3 bucket, and ensure that Weights & Biases is granted permission to read the artifact. Additionally, you can try specifying a different version of the artifact, or check if the path or filename is correct. Finally, you can also check if the artifact type is correct and that you have successfully logged an artifact of that type."
"A user is trying to download a reference artifact using W&B and encountering errors.
","I am trying to download a reference artifact using W&B but I keep getting errors. How can I troubleshoot this?
","To download a reference artifact, you can use the `use_artifact()` method of the `wandb` module. Make sure you are using the correct `type` parameter to indicate the type of artifact you are downloading. If you are encountering errors, make sure that the artifact exists and is accessible with the provided configuration. In some cases, rich media such as images, audio, video, and point clouds may fail to render properly in the App UI depending on the CORS configuration of your bucket. Allow listing `app.wandb.ai` in your bucket's CORS settings will allow the App UI to properly render such rich media."

","I want to download a reference artifact from my Weights & Biases account. Can you explain the differences between using shared credentials file vs. a config file and what is the best practice?
","There are different ways to access your reference artifacts in Weights & Biases, and the best option depends on your specific use case. If you plan to use the same credentials across multiple applications, you can store your credentials in a shared credentials file. On the other hand, if you want to store different configurations per application, you should use a config file. For more information on how to set up and use the different options, please refer to the documentation."

","Weights & Biases recommends enabling 'Object Versioning' on your Amazon S3 or GCS buckets if you overwrite files as part of your workflow. With versioning enabled, artifacts referenced to files that have been overwritten will still be intact since the older object versions are retained. Additionally, you can use the metadata recorded when the artifact was logged to retrieve the files from the underlying bucket when it downloads a reference artifact.
