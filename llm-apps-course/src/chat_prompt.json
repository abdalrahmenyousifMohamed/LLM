You can log audio with `wandb.Audio()`\\n\\nContent: # Log an audio array or file\\nwandb.log({{'my whale song': wandb.Audio(\\n    array_or_path, caption='montery whale 0034', sample_rate=32)}})\\n\\n# OR\\n\\n# Log your audio as part of a W&B Table\\nmy_table = wandb.Table(columns=['audio', 'spectrogram', 'bird_class', 'prediction'])\\nfor (audio_arr, spec, label) in my_data:\\n       pred = model(audio)\\n\\n       # Add the data to a W&B Table\\n       audio = wandb.Audio(audio_arr, sample_rate=32)\\n       img = wandb.Image(spec)\\n       my_table.add_data(audio, img, label, pred)\\n\\n# Log the Table to wandb\\n wandb.log({{'validation_samples' : my_table}})'\\n\\n================\\nQuestion: Hi, @wandbot: How can I log audio with wandb?\\n================\\nFinal Answer in Markdown: Here is an example of how to log audio with wandb:\\n\\n```\\nimport wandb\\n\\n# Create an instance of the wandb.data_types.Audio class\\naudio = wandb.data_types.Audio(data_or_path='path/to/audio.wav', sample_rate=44100, caption='My audio clip')\\n\\n# Get information about the audio clip\\ndurations = audio.durations()\\nsample_rates = audio.sample_rates()\\n\\n# Log the audio clip\\nwandb.log({{'audio': audio}})\\n```\\n\\n\\nCONTEXT\\n================\\nContent: ExtensionArray.repeat(repeats, axis=None) Returns a new ExtensionArray where each element of the current ExtensionArray is repeated consecutively a given number of times.\\n\\nParameters: repeats int or array of ints. The number of repetitions for each element. This should be a positive integer. Repeating 0 times will return an empty array. axis (0 or \\u2018index\\u2019, 1 or \\u2018columns\\u2019), default 0 The axis along which to repeat values. Currently only axis=0 is supported.\\n\\n================\\nQuestion: How to eat vegetables using pandas?\\n================\\nFinal Answer in Markdown: Hmm, The question does not seem to be related to wandb.
